IE 421 - Data Science for Engineers Term Project 'The Asymptote of Olympic Glory'

This repository presents a comprehensive data science analysis exploring the biological and cultural limits of human athletic performance through 120 years of Olympic history (1896-2020). Using advanced statistical modeling and extreme value theory, we investigate whether humanity is approaching the mathematical ceiling of physical achievement, and examine the cultural factors that determine Olympic dominance in this era of converging performance.
The project reveals that human performance has reached approximately 99% of biological capacity across major Olympic sports, with future improvements measured in millimeters and milliseconds rather than breakthrough achievements. Through regression analysis, performance saturation indices, and cultural correlation studies, we demonstrate how the Olympics have transitioned from an era of human expansion to one of human convergence—approaching the asymptote of what is physically possible.

Research Questions Explored

1. Are we approaching the biological limits of human performance?

  Analysis of 100m sprint and swimming records using asymptotic modeling
  Performance Saturation Index (PSI) calculations showing 99% capacity utilization
  

2. Does culture predict Olympic success more than resources?

Hofstede's Individualism Index correlated with medal counts
Controls for GDP per capita and population size


3. How has the age structure of elite athletes evolved?

Three-era analysis: Turbulence (1900-1950), Youth Focus (1950-1980), Veteran Rise (1980-present)
